     The 'Manitoba.lakes' data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. The
     areas and elevations of the nine largest lakes in Manitoba,
     Canada.  The geography of Manitoba (a relatively flat province)
     can be divided crudely into three main areas: a very flat prairie
     in the south which is at a  relatively high elevation, a middle
     region consisting of mainly of forest and Precambrian rock, and a
     northern region which drains more rapidly into Hudson Bay.  All
     water in Manitoba, which does not evaporate, eventually drains 
     into Hudson Bay.
