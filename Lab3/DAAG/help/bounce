_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Return univariate plotting positions in which neighboring points
     are separated, if and as necessary, so that they are the specified
     minimum distance apart.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bounce(y, d, log = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       y: A numeric vector of plotting positions

       d: Minimum required distance between neighboring positions

     log: 'TRUE' if values are will be plotted on a logarithmic scale.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The centroid(s) of groups of points that are moved relative to
     each other remain the same.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector of values such that, when plotted along a line,
     neighboring points are the required minimum distance apart.

_N_o_t_e:

     If values are plotted on a logarithmic scale, 'd' is the required
     distance apart on that scale. If a base other than 10 is required,
     set 'log' equal to that base.  (Note that base 10 is the default
     for 'plot' with 'log=TRUE'.)
