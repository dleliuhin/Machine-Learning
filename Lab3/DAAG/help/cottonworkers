_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Numbers are given in different categories of worker, in each of
     two investigations.  The first source of information is the Board
     of Trade Census that was conducted on 1886.  The second is a
     relatively informal survey conducted by US Bureau of Labor
     representatives in 1889, for use in official reports.
