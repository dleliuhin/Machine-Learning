_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Data record, for each of 2000 administrative regions, whether or
     not dengue was recorded at any time between 1961 and 1990.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(dengue)

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     A data frame with 2000 observations on the following 13 variables.

     _h_u_m_i_d Average vapour density: 1961-1990

     _h_u_m_i_d_9_0 90th percentile of 'humid'

     _t_e_m_p Average temperature: 1961-1990

     _t_e_m_p_9_0 90th percentile of 'temp'

     _h_1_0_p_i_x maximum of \texttt{humid}, within a 10 pixel radius

     _h_1_0_p_i_x_9_0 maximum of \texttt{humid90}, within a 10 pixel radius

     _t_r_e_e_s Percent tree cover, from satellite data

     _t_r_e_e_s_9_0 90th percentile of \texttt{trees}

     _N_o_Y_e_s Was dengue observed? (1=yes)

     _X_m_i_n minimum longitude

     _X_m_a_x maximum longitude

     _Y_m_i_n minimum latitude

     _Y_m_a_x maximum latitude

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This is derived from a data set in which the climate and tree
     cover information were given for each half degree of latitude by
     half degreee of longitude pixel. The variable 'NoYes' was given by
     administrative region. The climate data and tree cover data given
     here are 50th or 90th percentiles, where percetiles were
     calculates across pixels for an administrative region.

     distribution of dengue fever: an empirical model.  The Lancet
