_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     A data frame with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.

     _w_a_t_t_s_P_e_r_K_g a numeric vector: watts per kilogram of body weight

     _o_2 a numeric vector: ml/min/kg

     _i_d a factor with levels 1 - 5 ('humanpower1') or 1 - 4
          ('humanpower2'), identifying the different athletes

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Data in 'humanpower1' are from investigations (Bussolari 1987)
     designed to assess the feasibility of a proposed 119 kilometer
     human powered flight from the island of Crete - in the initial
     phase of the Daedalus project.  Data are for five athletes - a
     female hockey player, a male amateur tri-athlete, a female amateur
     triathlete, a male wrestler and a male cyclist - who were selected
     from volunteers who were recruited through the news media, Data in
     'humanpower2) are for four out of the 25 applicants who were
     selected for further testing, in the lead-up to the eventual
     selection of a pilot for the Daedalus project (Nadel and Bussolari
     1988). '
