     The 'modelcars' data frame has 12 rows and 2 columns. The data are
     for an experiment in which a model car was released three times at
     each of four different distances up a 20 degree ramp.  The
     experimenter recorded distances traveled from the  bottom of the
     ramp across a concrete floor.

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     This data frame contains the following columns:

     _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e._t_r_a_v_e_l_e_d a numeric vector consisting of the lengths
          traveled (in cm)

     _s_t_a_r_t_i_n_g._p_o_i_n_t a numeric vector consisting of the distance of the
          starting point from the top of the ramp (in cm)
