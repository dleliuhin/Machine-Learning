     These data are pertinent to an investigation of the way that   
     earnings changed, between 1974-1975 and 1978, in the absence of
     training.  The data frame combines data for the experimental
     treatment  group (NSW, 185 observations), using as control data
     results from the PSID  (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) study (128
     observations).  The latter were chosen to mimic the
     characteristics of the NSW training and control groups.  These are
     a subset of the 'nsw74psid1' data.
