_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function performs a t-test for the mean difference for paired
     data, and produces a scatterplot of one column against the other
     column, showing  whether there was any benefit to using the paired
     design.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    dset: a matrix or dataframe having two columns

       x: name of column to play the role of the `predictor' 

       y: name of column to play the role of the `response' 

    xlab: horizontal axis label 

    ylab: vertical axis label 

 dubious: 

    conv: 

     dig: 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A scatterplot of 'y' against 'x' together with estimates of
     standard errors and standard errors of the difference  ('y'-'x').

     Also produced is a confidence interval and p-value for the test.
