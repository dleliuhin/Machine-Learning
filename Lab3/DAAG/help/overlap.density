_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Densities for two independent samples are estimated and plotted.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     overlap.density(x0, x1, ratio=c(0.05, 20), compare.numbers=TRUE, 
     plotit=TRUE, gpnames=c("Control", "Treatment"), xlab="Score")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      x0: control group measurements

      x1: treatment group measurements

   ratio: the range within which the relative numbers of observations
          from the two groups are required to lie.  [The relative
          numbers at any point are estimated from
          (density1*n1)/(density0*x0)]

compare.numbers: If TRUE (default), then density plots are scaled to
          have total area equal to the sample size; otherwise total
          area under each density is 1

  plotit: If TRUE, a plot is produced

 gpnames: Names of the two samples

    xlab: Label for x-axis
