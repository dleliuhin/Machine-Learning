     Densities for two independent samples are estimated and plotted.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      x0: control group measurements

      x1: treatment group measurements

   ratio: the range within which the relative numbers of observations
          from the two groups are required to lie.  [The relative
          numbers at any point are estimated from
          (density1*n1)/(density0*x0)]

compare.numbers: If TRUE (default), then density plots are scaled to
          have total area equal to the sample size; otherwise total
          area under each density is 1

  plotit: If TRUE, a plot is produced

 gpnames: Names of the two samples

 cutoffs: logical vector, indicating whether density estimates should
          be truncated below (lower=TRUE) or above (upper=TRUE)

      bw: logical, indicates whether to overwrite with a gray scale
          plot

    xlab: Label for x-axis

     col: standard color parameter

     lty: standard line type preference
