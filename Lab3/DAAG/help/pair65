     The 'pair65' data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. Eighteen elastic
     bands were divided into nine pairs, with bands of similar
     stretchiness placed in the same pair. One member of each pair was
     placed in hot water (60-65 degrees C) for four minutes, while the
     other was left at ambient temperature.  After a wait of about ten
     minutes, the amounts of stretch, under a 1.35 kg weight, were
     recorded.
