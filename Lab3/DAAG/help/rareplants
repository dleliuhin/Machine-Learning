     These data were taken from species lists for South Australia,
     Victoria and  Tasmania.  Species were classified as CC, CR, RC and
     RR, with C denoting common and R denoting rare.  The first code
     relates to South Australia  and Victoria, and the second to
     Tasmania.  They were further classified by habitat according to
     the Victorian register, where D = dry only,  W = wet only, and WD
     = wet or dry.
