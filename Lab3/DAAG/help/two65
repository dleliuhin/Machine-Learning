     Twenty-one elastic bands were divided into two groups.

     One of the sets was placed in hot water (60-65 degrees C) for four
     minutes, while the other was left at ambient temperature.  After a
     wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch, under a 1.35 kg
     weight, were recorded.
