     Data on objects appearing in three windows on a video lottery
     terminal, together with the prize payout (usually 0). Observations
     were taken on two successive days in late 1994 at a hotel lounge
     north of Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Each observation cost 25 cents
     (Canadian).  The game played was `Double Diamond'.

     This data frame contains the following columns:

     _w_i_n_d_o_w_1 object appearing in the first window.

     _w_i_n_d_o_w_2 object appearing in the second window.

     _w_i_n_d_o_w_3 object appearing in the third window.

     _p_r_i_z_e cash prize awarded (in Canadian dollars).

     _n_i_g_h_t 1, if observation was taken on day 1; 2, if observation was
          taken on day 2.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     At each play, each of three windows shows one of 7 possible
     objects. Apparently, the three windows are independent of each
     other, and the objects should appear with equal probability across
     the three windows.   The objects are coded as follows: blank (0),
     single bar (1), double bar (2), triple bar (3), double diamond
     (5), cherries (6), and  the numeral "7" (7).  

     Prizes (in quarters) are awarded according to the following
     scheme:   800 (5-5-5), 80 (7-7-7), 40 (3-3-3), 25 (2-2-2), 10
     (1-1-1), 10 (6-6-6), 5 (2 "6"'s), 2 (1 "6") and 5 (any combination
     of "1", "2" and "3"). In addition, a "5" doubles any winning
     combination, e.g. (5-3-3) pays 80 and (5-3-5) pays 160.
