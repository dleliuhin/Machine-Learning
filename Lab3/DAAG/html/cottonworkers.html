<h2>Occupation and wage profiles of British cotton workers</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Numbers are given in different categories of worker, in each of
two investigations.  The first source of information is the
Board of Trade Census that was conducted on 1886.  The second
is a relatively informal survey conducted by US Bureau of
Labor representatives in 1889, for use in official reports.
