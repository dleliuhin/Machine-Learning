\begin{Description}\relax
The \code{pair65} data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns.
Eighteen elastic bands were divided into nine pairs, with bands
of similar stretchiness placed in the same pair. One member of
each pair was placed in hot water (60-65 degrees C) for four
minutes, while the other was left at ambient temperature.  After
a wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch, under a 1.35 kg
weight, were recorded.
