\begin{Description}\relax
Twenty-one elastic bands were divided into two groups.

One of the sets was placed in hot water (60-65 degrees C) for four
minutes, while the other was left at ambient temperature.  After
a wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch, under a 1.35 kg
weight, were recorded.
